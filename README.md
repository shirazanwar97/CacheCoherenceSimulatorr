# Shared Cache Coherent Protocol Simulator

## Academic Project

### Shared Cache Coherent Protocol Simulator, Architecture of Parallel Computers

- Modeled a simulator with 4 processor cores and a shared L1 cache.
- Implemented MSI and Dragon coherence protocols.

This project highlights the development of a shared cache coherent protocol simulator, demonstrating the implementation of MSI and Dragon protocols to manage cache coherence in a multi-core processor environment within the realm of parallel computer architecture.
